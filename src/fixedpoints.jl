# Could compute fixed points at desired timesteps in the the interval
# because the `ChaosTools.fixedpoints` function sets t = 0.0, but one 
# could easily pass a timestep parameter to this and see fixed points at that
# points (look at Figure 3 in color and notice how fixed points correspond
# to different points on the gaussian curve)
