* Background: germinal center exist in lymph nodes (part of immune system)

* When you get sick, that is when a pathogen has entered your body (virus, bacteria, fungi, etc.),
germinal center as part of your immune system's response, will convert (differentiate)
naive B-cells --> memory B-cells or plasma cells. These serve different roles, but they both
generally fight off the pathogen.

* At the beginning of immune response, these germinal centers have naive B-cells (called centroblasts)
and after a few days these B-cells migrate to a part of the germinal center called the light zone, 
and are exposed to antigens (part of a pathogen) and at this point the naive centroblast is now
called centrocytes 

* These centrocytes will then either die essentially or they transition to plasma cells

# Slide 3

* Example trajectories 

* Standard deviation is quite small on the scale so the gaussian peak is sharp

# Slide 4

* We want to know what is the equilibrium behavior the so-called BCR subnetwork, so this is just 
those previous ODEs except we assume that IRF4 is not undergoing expression

* Nullclines here is just curves at values of particular state variable when rate of change of that 
state variable is 0 (steady state). 

* When the curves intersect you have a bistable system and this is further
confirmed with bifurcation diagrams for different system parameters

# Slide 5

* Now we are looking essentially a sensitivity analysis but shown through bifurcation diagrams
of BCL6 (which is known to be key in B-cell differentiation) and the different system parameters
(transcription rates, degradation rates, and other such rate constants for the BLIMP1 (p), BCL6 (b),
and IRF4 (r), respectively).

* Showing that IRF4 plays a critical role in B-cell differentiation to plasma cells
through bistable regime while others are in monostable regime

# Slide 6

* Is bistability that is present in the systems in which BCR and CD40 surface cell regulators 
are now modeled as gaussian pdfs (because this is more realistic). 

* Summary: simulated proof of the importance of BCL6 and IRF4 in the differentiation of 
naive B-cells to plasma cells, or more informally, under what circumstances the body
will effectively produce antibodies to pathogens
